        <p align="justify">
          I was born in Vietnam and immigrated to San Diego in 1999 with my mother, a single parent who raised me on her own while working in nail salons. The first in my family to attend college, I earned my Bachelor's degree from Stanford University and my Master in Public Affairs from Princeton University.

        <p align="justify">
          I have extensive experience in policy analysis; project management; politics; communications; and advocacy. I served on Hillary Clinton’s policy team during the 2016 Presidential Campaign and was Domestic and Economic Policy Advisor for the Clinton-Kaine Presidential Transition (pre-election). Afterwards, I served as Senior Policy Advisor to Phil Murphy (now Governor of New Jersey), where I managed a policy portfolio on economic, tech and innovation, health care, education, and federal issues. Most recently, I spearheaded a statewide political campaign for <a href="http://www.vivekforca.com">Vivek Viswanathan</a> – Democratic candidate for California State Treasurer.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          I have a track record of advancing social programs and labor initiatives at the state and national level. I was a core member of the team that crafted the <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/san-francisco-limits-on-worker-schedules-113177">first-in-the-nation</a> law to provide predictable work schedules for hourly, retail workers in San Francisco. Through the California Work & Family Coalition, I pushed to expand paid family leave, child care, and early childhood initiatives in California. In 2016, I published a pay equity report commissioned by the Public Advocate of NYC, which led to Mayor de Blasio <a href="http://pubadvocate.nyc.gov/news/articles/groundbreaking-equal-pay-legislation-passes-new-york-city">adopting legislation</a> banning employers from asking about salary history.

          I am the co-founder of NaturalizeUs, an initiative helping immigrants become U.S. citizens and registered voters, funded by Princeton University's Keller Center for Innovation.
