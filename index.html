          As a first-generation college graduate, I completed my undergraduate education at Stanford University and earned my Master in Public Affairs from Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.

        <p align="justify">
          I have a background in policy, research, communications, and advocacy work. I served on Hillary Clinton’s policy team during the 2016 Presidential Election and later on the Clinton-Kaine Transition (pre-election). After the national election, I came on as a senior policy advisor to Phil Murphy, the Democratic nominee for Governor of New Jersey, where I managed a policy portfolio on economic, tech and innovation, health care, education, and federal issues.

          In California, I worked with unions and statewide coalitions to advance labor initiatives, and I drafted core parts of the <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/san-francisco-limits-on-worker-schedules-113177">first-in-the-nation</a> law that provides the right to predictable work schedules for hourly, retail workers in San Francisco. I have served on state and local task forces and committees, and testified regularly at legislative hearings. In New York City, I published a pay equity report commissioned by the Public Advocate, which led to <a href="http://pubadvocate.nyc.gov/news/articles/groundbreaking-equal-pay-legislation-passes-new-york-city">passed legislation</a> banning employers from asking for salary history.

          I am the co-founder of NaturalizeUS, an initiative to promote the stories and contributions of immigrants across America, and to sponsor immigrants to apply for citizenship. This is an endeavor motivated by my personal background: I was born in Vietnam and emigrated to Southern California as a child, where I grew up among a diverse community of immigrants. 
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          In my spare time, I enjoy running, hiking, rock climbing, eating ice cream, and playing strategic board games.
