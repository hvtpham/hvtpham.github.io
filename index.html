          My background is in policy, research, communications, and advocacy. I served on Hillary Clinton’s policy team during the 2016 Presidential Election and later on the Clinton-Kaine Transition (pre-election). After the national election, I came on as a senior policy advisor to Phil Murphy, the Democratic nominee for Governor of New Jersey, where I managed a policy portfolio on economic, tech and innovation, health care, education, and federal issues.

        In my previous role with the California Work & Family Coalition, I worked to advance labor initiatives that help working families, such as paid family leave and paid sick days. I also crafted key parts of the <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/san-francisco-limits-on-worker-schedules-113177">first-in-the-nation</a> law that provides the right to predictable work schedules for hourly, retail workers in San Francisco. In 2016, I published a pay equity report commissioned by the Public Advocate of New York City, which led to <a href="http://pubadvocate.nyc.gov/news/articles/groundbreaking-equal-pay-legislation-passes-new-york-city">successful legislation</a> banning employers from asking about salary history.

          I am the co-founder of NaturalizeUS, an initiative that promotes the stories and contributions of immigrants across America, and sponsors immigrants to apply for citizenship. I was born in Vietnam and emigrated to Southern California as a child. As a first-generation college graduate, I completed my undergraduate education at Stanford University and earned my Master in Public Affairs from Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.

          In my spare time, I enjoy running, hiking, rock climbing, eating ice cream, and playing board games.
